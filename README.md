# hopper

Unfortunately i'm no longer maintaining this code. Please don't deploy it in any
sort of public format as the dependencies within it are not up to date with
latest security fixes.

hopper is a scheduling system for fairly complex events where the constraints 
between events are more complex than simply assigning speakers to slots.

To support this, hopper provides a drag 'n' drop scheduling arrangement, to 
allow the events to be reordered without much work
